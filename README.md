# DumbGPT - The stupid AI chatbot

DumbGPT is the ultimate AI chatbot that does everything *except* answer your questions correctly. Based on Google's Gemini, this AI takes absurdity to the next level with its chaotic and nonsensical responses. And if that's not enough, **Brainrot Mode** cranks up the nonsense to pure, incomprehensible madness. 💀

## Features 🎉

🧠 **Brainrot Mode** – Activating this mode will make DumbGPT generate responses with absolute brainrot energy. Expect internet jargon, absurdist humor, and total chaos.

⚠️ **Brainrot Pop-ups** – Surprise pop-ups that remind you that your sanity is at risk.

🤖 **Gemini-Powered** – Built on Google's Gemini AI, but with all intelligence removed for maximum dumbness.

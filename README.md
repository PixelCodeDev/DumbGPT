# DumbGPT - The stupid AI chatbot

DumbGPT is the ultimate AI chatbot that does everything *except* answer your questions correctly. Based on Google's Gemini, this AI takes absurdity to the next level with its chaotic answers. And if that's not enough, **Brainrot Mode** cranks up the nonsense to literal brain melting 💀.
